MMB is the set of Dockerfiles and assets for building Docker images with different services (such as [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com), [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com), etc.), intended primarily, but **not only**, for running on Raspberry Pis and other single board computers.

MMB stands for "Mr. Meeseeks Box". The project name was inspired by the episode ["Meeseeks and Destroy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeseeks_and_Destroy) of an animated sitcom [Rick and Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty).

## Getting started

This instructions will help you build and run services from the project.

### Prerequisites

You will need Docker and docker-compose (>= 1.10.0).

### Build

Assuming you would like to build a Docker image with MariaDB. Execute

```
$ sudo ./mmb.sh mariadb armhf
```

or 

```
$ sudo ./mmb.sh mariadb
```

to build a Docker image for `armhf` port. If the target platform is based on x86_64, substitute `armhf` for `amd64`. For example,

```
$ sudo ./mmb.sh mariadb amd64
```

By the way, you can avoid using the `mmb.sh` script and build the image in a little more challenging way:

```
$ cd mariadb
$ IMAGE_NAME=`grep "image: " docker-compose.yml | awk -F': ' '{print $2}'`
$ docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME} .
$ if [ -f postinst.sh ]; then ./postinst.sh; fi
```

### Run

To run the container, go to the directory of the target service and execute

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Make sure that the container is in the RUNNING state, executing

```
$ docker ps
```

If the container is not present in the list, execute `docker-compose` without the `-d` option to figure out the reason. For example,

```
$ docker-compose up
```
