MMB is the set of Dockerfiles and assets for building Docker images with different services (such as [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com), [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com), etc.), intended for running on Raspberry Pis and other single board computers.

MMB stands for "Mr. Meeseeks Box". The project name was inspired by the episode ["Meeseeks and Destroy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeseeks_and_Destroy) of an animated sitcom [Rick and Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty).
